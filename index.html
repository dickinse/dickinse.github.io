            <h1>Hi</h1><h2>I'm Erika,</h2>
            <p>and I currently reside in Boston, Massachusetts. I am a software tester by day, and a nerd by night.</p>
          <p>I am extremely motivated by the prospect of ingenuity. I love making things work better and helping people to work a smarter, not harder. Every day I go into work, I try to make one thing a little bit better; one process a little more seamless. It is impossible to solve everything all at once, but if I can make one process a little clearer or more streamlined, thatâ€™s a step on the road I am happy to be on.</p>
          <p>I bring my very diverse background. I have worked for a long time in the field of hospitality, and so I understand a little bit more of how the average person thinks. This allows me to create a more diverse array of test cases that others who have only worked in one field might struggle with. I also have quite a bit of managerial experience, and this allows me to give sound advice as well as confidentially take initiative in ways others might not.</p>
          <p>I am also a poet and a photographer in my spare time. I shoot mostly black and white street photography on film, and do most of the development myself. As for my poetry, I can be found at various open mics around the city throughout the month. When not engaging with either of these hobbies, I also run a few Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.</p>
